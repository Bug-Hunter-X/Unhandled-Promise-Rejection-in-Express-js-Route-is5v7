This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation might throw an error without proper handling. The solution, `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates the correct way to handle such errors using a `catch` block or a `try...catch` statement within the asynchronous function or promise chain.
